3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal

### Context ‚ùì:
- This is a pair-programming project completed by 2 Turing student's in our 2nd week of the 7 month program. We have focused mainly on JS fundamentals to this point. This project represents our first real exposure to HTML & CSS. We took roughly 10 hours to update the JS to provide the user with a seemless & intuitive experience.
